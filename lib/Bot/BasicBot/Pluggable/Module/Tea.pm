You will need to load the module into your instance:

    $bot->load('Tea');

Then when you fancy a brew, just issue the C<!tea> command:

    <adam> !tea
    <George> adam would like a brew! kristian: your turn!
    <kristian> d'oh!

    return <<HELPMSG;
        This plugin helps facilitae tea making within a team. Simply
        issue the `!tea` command when you fancy a brew and a new tea round
        will begin.

        If the user selected is away, issue `!tea away` and another user
        will be selected.

        If you want to jump in the queue and make a round of tea, issue the
        `!tea volunteer` command.

        If you want to see the current tea round status, issue `!tea status`.

        If you want to live on the edge issue the `!tea random` command to have
        someone at random selected to make the tea
